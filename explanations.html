                Wordpress vs. Bootstrap
            </h1>
            <p>
                Using Wordpress.com to build a site is very intuitive.  There are many themes to choose from, depending on the type of site you want, though some of them may cost money to use.
                There are certain 'quirks' to each theme that you may need to learn in order to get the best out of them, but it is all documented. Once you learn the ins and outs of Wordpress, further learning
                is limited to these special theme specific options.  Using Wordpress.com does not require that users know how to write HTML and CSS code. It is beneficial to know a little, but entire sites can be
                created without it.

                Bootstrap, on the other hand, is more difficult to use. With the added difficulty, comes the ability to create a completely custom, responsive website.  While more time consuming, the site can be taylored
                to a developer's/customer's specific needs. Unlike the 'no-code' solution of Wordpress, using Bootstrap requires that you know how to write HTML and CSS code, as well as knowing basic coding concepts and
                some Javascript.
